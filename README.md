# OpenGL Project

This project uses modern OpenGL for rendering, along with several supporting libraries to simplify development and improve functionality.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

The following libraries and APIs are used in this project:

- **OpenGL** – Core graphics rendering API.
- **GLFW** – Window creation and input handling.
- **GLM** – Mathematics library for graphics applications (vectors, matrices, transformations).
- **GLEW** – OpenGL Extension Wrangler for accessing modern OpenGL functions.
- **stb_image.h** – Header-only image loading library (used for textures).

## 🛠️ Building the Project

Make sure you have all the dependencies installed and linked properly in your build system (e.g., `CMake`, `Makefile`, or directly in your IDE).

Typical linking includes:
- `-lGL -lglfw -lGLEW`
